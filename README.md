This repository contains BANSHEE - A MATLAB Toolbox for Non-Parametric Bayesian Networks. 

Bayesian Networks (BNs) are probabilistic, graphical models for representing complex dependency structures. They have many applications in science and engineering. This toolbox implements a particularly powerful variant Non-Parametric BNs. The software allows for quantifying the BN, validating the underlying assumptions of the model, visualizing the network and its corresponding rank correlation matrix, and finally making inference with a BN based on existing or new evidence. The toolbox also includes some applied BN models published in recent scientific literature.

The src/ directory contains BANSHEE.mltbx file containing installer of the MATLAB toolbox.

The docs/ directory contains a quick start guide to the toolbox. Please consult the guide before using the toolbox.
